    Represents an environment variable (<env> tag in roslaunch), see http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML/env
    This class cannot be used inside a Machine object (deprecated since ROS Fuerte). However, you can use this
    class to create remote env. variables by setting the "value" to an resolvable object, see remote.py. Also note that
    env. variables are being propagated to nodes if they are added to Groups or Launch objects, see
    Composer.add_env_variables_to_nodes() for more information. For instance:
    root += EnvironmentVariable('ROSCONSOLE_CONFIG_FILE', Path('/config/rosconsole.cfg', pkg))
    (assuming "root" is a "Launch" object), would cause the env. variable to be added to all nodes started afterwards.
    If one of these nodes is started on system A, and another one is launched on system B, the env. variable will be
    resolved remotely on theses systems A and B respectively (given the "pkg" where the path relates to).
